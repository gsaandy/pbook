help me create a PRD for a web application with the following, this is for tracking the cash collection of a nestle distribution, we have the following
1. Shops with addresses, phone number
2. Each shop will be associated with a route. is labeling works here?
3. We are the distributor, and have employees who collect the cash from the shops

Now, I want to create a web application to
- Manage routes. or labels? give me ideas
- Manage shops
- Manage employees
- Manage cash collection
- Reports
    - Manage cash collection reports
    - Manage route based reports
- Employees need their own logins and passwords to access the system
- Employees will need to be able to add the cash received from the shop to the system
- When employees add the balance cash received, the balance can tally to 0 if it amounts to 0, but the entry can only be closed by the admin when they receive the cash from the employee
- Admin will need to be able to view all the entries and be able to close the entry when they receive the cash from the employee. When the entry is closed, the employee will not be able to add more cash to the entry.
